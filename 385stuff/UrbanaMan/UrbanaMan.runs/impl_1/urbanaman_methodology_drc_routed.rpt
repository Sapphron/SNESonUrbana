TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_100 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock mb_usb/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_100 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
